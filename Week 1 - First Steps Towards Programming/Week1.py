# Numbers
# Use Python as calculator

5+5
# 10

10.5-2*3
# 4.5

10**2
# Used to calculate powers so 100 in this case

17.0//3
# Floor division - discards fractional part, so 5.0 in this case

17%3
# Modulo operator - returns remainder after division


# Types of Numbers

type(5)
# type 'int'

# Integers, float (decimal point present), complex (e.g. 3+2j)
# Note, in Python 2 something like 12/5 = 2, because you have to specify that 12 is a float in order to obtain a float result
# So 12.0/5 = 2.4

# Strings
# Especially NB in genomics - strings of letters surrounded by quotes

"atg"
# 'atg'

"This is a codon"
# 'This is a codon' (string as single object)
