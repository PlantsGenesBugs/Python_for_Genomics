## Week 1 - First steps in Programming

Programming can be useful to be independent in the work you want to do. It can also help you to udnerstand output produced by other scientists (involving bioinformatics and genomics) better.

#### Programming strategies

Some thoughts about Good Programming (which is fairly nondescript and somewhat subjective): 

1. Identify required inputs (what do I need?)
2. Make an overall design for the program (human-readable plan for all the steps the program will perform; pseudocode) (how will I proceed?)
3. Decide what the output of the program will be (file/output/other)
4. Refine the overall design by specifying more detail (are any details missing in my overall design?)
5. Write the program

Pseudocode: computer-like but human readable. Similar to what you'd add as comments inbetween coding lines.

**Example 1**: *Write a program that calculates the average value of a series of numbers*  
Pseudocode:
 - Get numbers by user input
 - Count number of entries
 - Add together individual numbers
 - Divide sum of numbers by number of entries
 - Display value on screen

**Example 2**: *Write a program to convert temperature from degrees C to F*  
Pseudocode:
- Get value in C from user
- Multiply value by 1.8 and add 32
- Display value on screen

Note: Python isn't compiled. It is interpreted as is. A draw-back is that it runs slower than programs written in C/C++ which will be a better option for very large data sets.

Useful Python Resources:  
[Python site](http://www.python.org)  
[Think Python (Allen B. Downey)](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/)  

Installing Python:  
Get Python from the website (Python.org) and install it
Open terminal window (Command Prompt on Windows)  
Type "python" at caret
Will run python and give details about version, shows >>> where you can input commands  

Alternatively:  
Download Anaconda from [anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and install
Open Anaconda  
Open Jupyter Notebook application  
Run code in pre-made cells in this environment
