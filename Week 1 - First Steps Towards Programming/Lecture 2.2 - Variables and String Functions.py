# Variables
# Storage container for numbers, strings and other values

# Equal sign used to asign a value to a variable
codon = "atg"
dna_sequence = "gtccgaatagtcccatagtacacatggc"

# Give variables MEANINGFUL names
# Note there are restrictions to variable names - case sensitive, can only have letters, numbers (not first letter) and underscore

# Indexing and slicing
# [x] gives character at position x (note, first position is 0) 
# [x:y] slices a substring between positions x and y (excluding y)

dna = "AATTGCGATGGGC"
dna[0]
# 'A'

dna[2:4]
# 'TTâ€™

dna[-1]
# 'C'

dna[-3:-1]
# 'GG'

dna[:4] # is the same as dna[0:4]; omitting the first defaults to zero; omitting the last defaults to the final position
# 'AATT'

# Useful String Functions
# Length of a string: len()

len(dna)
# 13

# Other functions include type() and print(); find help by using help() and putting function name in brackets (e.g. help(len))

dna.lower() #will show what dna would look like all lower case
# 'aattgcgatgggc'

dna.find("AT") # finds the FIRST INSTANCE of the substring and gives the index position
# 1

dna.find("ATG")
# 7

# If you want to keep on looking, do the search again, but instruct python to start looking one position beyond the initial discovery
dna.find("GC")
# 4

dna.find("GC", 5)
# 11

dna.islower()
# False


# Strings as Objects
# Strings have variable names and values. They can also perform specific actions, called methods

dna.count("G") #counts the number of times "G" appears in the string called "dna"; "ask object dna to do method count"
# 5

# can also count substrings
dna.count("GC")
# 2

# To replace specific values in the string
dna.replace("A", "a")
# 'aaTTGCGaTGGGC' this does NOT change the string (you have to redefine it to affect the change)


# Find methods for the type `str` using help(str)
