# Python_for_Genomics
Repository for course work, notes and exercises while I complete the Johns Hopkins "Python for Genomic Data Science" course through coursera. No quiz answers will be shared, although I hope that the content will provide sufficient information for others to complete their own quizes under their own steam.
