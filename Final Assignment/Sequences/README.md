## Wheat perixodase sequences

The sequences in this folder were downloaded from [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore) on 7 January 2024. A search was performed with the keywords: `(wheat peroxidase) AND "Triticum aestivum"[porgn:__txid4565] ` and filtering for mRNA molecule types and Nucleotide sequence type. Full search criteria: `(("Triticum aestivum"[Organism] OR wheat[All Fields]) AND peroxidase[All Fields]) AND "Triticum aestivum"[porgn] AND (biomol_mrna[PROP] AND is_nuccore[filter])`.

Sequences were selected that had no introns and a full coding sequence. Additional sequences from other species were added after performing a search only for "wheat peroxidase".
