## Week 4 - outside communication and BioPython

Notes on files:

- myfasta.txt is a file containing 6 BLAST hits from different plant species, after BLAST search at NCBI with the wheat RuBisCo large subunit gene. The sequences are fairly long.
- fasta.txt is a file containing 2 shorter DNA sequences - a cytochrome P450 candidate and GABA transporter I in humans
