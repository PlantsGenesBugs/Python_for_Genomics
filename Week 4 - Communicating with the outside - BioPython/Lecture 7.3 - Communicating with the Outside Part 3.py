# How to retrieve data from a dictionary that you built:

# Remember the .keys() and .values() methods from lecture 3.2
# Can also retrieve key + value using .items() method and looping through the whole dictionary

for name, seq in seqs.items():
    print(name, seq)            # Because my example file has large sequences, this comes out as a very big block of data!
